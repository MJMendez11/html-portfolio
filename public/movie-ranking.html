<h3>Catch Me If You Can</h3>
<p>This is my favourite film. Tom Hanks and Leonardo Di Caprio are both fantastic and it leaves you feeling a certain way at the end.</p>
<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie, really changes our thoughts and perception of a possible future!</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>A film that changed how we think about computers and the world! Keanu Reeves is also one of my favourite actors!</p>
